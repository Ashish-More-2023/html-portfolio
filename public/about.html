<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m a web developer and I love all things tech. When I’m not knee-deep in code, I’m probably reading up on the latest development trends or practicing my sketching (or both).</p>

<p>I got my start in technology as a self-taught coder, and since then I’ve never looked back. I specialize in front-end development, but I have a little bit of experience with everything from coding to QA to project management.</p>

<p>I am confident in my abilities and am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer. I am excited to share my skills with the world and hope to make a positive impact on the web development community.</p>
